# unit-4-game aka The Crystal Collector

This game is all about arithmetic, recogizing patterns and values. 

Four crystals appear on screen. 

Each has an integer value assigned to it but is unknown to the user until they click on that particular crystal. 

As the crystals are clicked, the user's running score is tabulated. This score must equal but not exceed the target score which is shown to the screen as "The Glow Goal". 

Like the values assigned to the crystals and are drawn to the screen during the onClick event, The Glow Goal is determined at random from the game's beginning. It does not chang, nor do the crystal values, until the next game begins.
