# unit-4-game aka The Crystal Collector

This game is all about arithmetic, recogizing patterns and values. 

Four (4) crystals appear on screen. 

Each has an integer value assigned to it but is unknown to the user until they click on that particular crystal. 

As the crystals are clicked, the user's running score is tabulated. This score must equal but not exceed the target score which is shown to the screen as "The Glow Goal". 

Like the values assigned to the crystals and are drawn to the screen during the onClick event, The Glow Goal is determined at random from the game's beginning. It does not chang, nor do the crystal values, until the next game begins.

Future development plans include the following mods:

(1) greater mobile responsiveness (2) refactorization of the called functions. At this point the called function is on each image's onClick even, thus not fullying utilizing the 'this' alias and assignment of a value from an stored attribute/data-value on the image and lastly at the game's conclusion; (3) there would be two resulting images drawn to the screen depending on the outcome: win or lose. These images have been identified and will be added this week (2019_April07) in time for this submission. If not, shortly thereafer.

ABOUT THE DESIGN:

variables, called functions and onClick events all contribute to the deployment.
